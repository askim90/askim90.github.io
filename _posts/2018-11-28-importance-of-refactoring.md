title: Importance of Refactoring
---

  There is a saying that goes, “If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it.” When a programmer finishes coding that sees that all tests pass, one would like to move on. While this may increase productivity in short term, there would be long term consequences if programmers neglect refactoring. One such consequence is poor readability. If names are not self explanatory and consistent, it would be waste of time and effort to find out the purpose of each named classes, methods, and variables. The other consequence is difficulty in making changes. Almost all modules will require to be changed at some point. It would be unnecessarily complicated to make changes if the modules are not refactored. One more consequence is unoptimized products. They would not be as fast and efficient as they could have been if algorithms are not improved and unnecessary functions are not removed.
