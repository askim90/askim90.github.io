title: 7 Symptoms of Bad Software Design
---

No software is perfect. Eventually, changes are needed to make on finished software. If the software was poorly designed, even a simple change may end up costing more work and time than estimated. Agile design prevents this by constantly reviewing code for the “smell” of “rotting” software as it is being developed. The 7 symptoms are:
    1. Rigidity - Every change forces other changes to parts of system. This is caused by too many dependencies.
    2. Fragility - Changes cause the system to break in many different places.
    3. Immobility - Difficulty in separating parts that could be reused in other systems.
    4. Viscosity - Doing things right way is harder than the wrong way.
    5. Needless Complexity - Unnecessary infrastructures
    6. Needless Repetition - Repeating structures that could be unified under single abstraction.
    7.Opacity - Code is hard to read and understand its intent.
